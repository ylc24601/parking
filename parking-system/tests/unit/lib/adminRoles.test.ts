// Wave 2C-1 (#19). The matrix is the single answer to "may this operator open that",
// shared by the server gates and the sidebar, so the table below is written out in full
// rather than derived — a test that computed the expectation the same way the code does
// would agree with any bug.
//
// The three capabilities exist because those three surfaces are NOT open to every admin.
// Everything else (bindings, members, eligibility, import, print, capacity, pastoral,
// staff PIN) is deliberately absent from the matrix: a capability for "what everyone can
// do" would make the lack of a check elsewhere look like an oversight.
