// Tier 0-2 (0038) — the two locking protocols this slice INTRODUCED, under real concurrency:
// two raw postgres connections with explicitly interleaved transactions.
//
// Why these two and not more: everything else 0038 claims is a single-transaction property a
// sequential test can prove. These two are claims ABOUT INTERLEAVING, and "the SQL looks
// right" is not evidence for those. Both protect against a wrong outcome that leaves no trace
// afterwards, which is exactly the kind of bug that never gets found in production.
//
//   (1) vehicle retirement vs a member applying for a space.
//       apply_reservation takes `vehicles ... FOR SHARE`; set_member_vehicle_active takes
//       FOR UPDATE. Without them the two interleave into an INACTIVE vehicle that owns a
//       fresh pending reservation — the exact state this slice exists to make impossible.
//       (The pre-existing member-apply-race.db.test.ts covers apply vs the Friday allocator,
//       i.e. the weekly_events lock. This is a different lock on a different row.)
//
//   (2) a phone change vs approving that member's LINE binding.
//       update_member_identity locks users → pending_binding; approve_pending_binding locks
//       pending_binding → users. Opposite orders, so 0038 puts a shared advisory lock in
//       front of both. Without it this is a textbook deadlock (40P01), and its trigger is
//       mundane: one clerk edits a phone while another approves that member's binding.
//

  // ── (1) vehicle retirement vs apply ────────────────────────────────────────────
  // Verified by removing 0038's `FOR SHARE` and re-running: only the SECOND test below
  // fails. That is worth writing down rather than leaving as a comfortable green.
  //
  // This first test blocks even WITHOUT the explicit lock, because inserting a reservation
  // takes an implicit FOR KEY SHARE on the referenced vehicles row to validate the composite
  // FK, and FOR KEY SHARE already conflicts with FOR UPDATE. So it documents the protocol
  // but does not isolate the line 0038 added.
  //
  // The second test is the one that does: without FOR SHARE the apply reads a stale "active"
  // under READ COMMITTED (a plain SELECT does not wait on a row-level write lock) and
  // succeeds — `applied: 1` against a car being retired, i.e. precisely the inactive-vehicle-
  // with-a-live-reservation state this slice exists to prevent.
