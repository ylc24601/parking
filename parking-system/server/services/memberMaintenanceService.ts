// ── Admin member maintenance (Tier 0-2 / 0038) ───────────────────────────────
// Four audited mutations that, before this slice, had no path at all: the CSV import was
// the only way to write member data, it keys members by PHONE, and vehicles were
// insert-only. See 0038's header for what that cost.
//
// This layer is deliberately thin, for the same reason adminAccountService is: each RPC
// owns its guards, its transaction and its audit row. So this service must not
//   * re-implement the name/phone/plate rules — the RPC is the single authority, and a
//     copy here would drift the moment one side changes (the CSV import proves the point:
//     its dry-run and apply agree only because ONE function answers both);
//   * write a second audit row — the app principal cannot execute the audit writer at all;
//   * catch a throw and report success — a throw means the transaction rolled back, audit
//     row included, so nothing happened.
//
// What it DOES own: threading the actor from the session, mapping the RPC's typed reasons
// onto a stable union, and keeping `homonym_requires_confirmation` legible as a step in a
// flow rather than an error.

// One HTTP mapping for the whole surface so four routes cannot invent four dialects.
//
//   403 — the ACTOR may not, as they are. Both are race guards: adminAuth deletes a
//         disabled account's session on every request, so neither should be reachable.
//   404 — the TARGET does not exist.
//   422 — the INPUT is malformed; the operator must fix the form. Retrying unchanged
//         fails identically forever.
//   409 — the input is fine and the CURRENT STATE refuses it. This is the honest status
//         for the inert cases too (already_inactive, active_plate_owned_by_self): the
//         request was understood, and the answer is "the world is already like that".
//
// homonym_requires_confirmation is a 409 rather than a 200 ON PURPOSE. It is the first
// step of a two-step flow, but it is NOT a success: nothing was created. Returning 200
// would make "member created" and "please look at these two people first" the same shape
// to any caller that checks only the status — and the browser is not the only caller.
