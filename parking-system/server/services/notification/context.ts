// Wave 1d (#27) — stamp the week and the car onto outbox payloads at ENQUEUE time.
//
// Why here and not in the dispatcher: templates.ts renders from the payload persisted on the row
// and nothing else, so the message is a snapshot of the moment it was queued. A member who swaps
// their vehicle after being approved should still see the plate they applied with.
//
// This is the single authority for `sunday_date` / `license_plate` in a payload: it overwrites
// whatever a producer may have put there, and it STRIPS `license_plate` from templates that
// don't render one — data the message won't show has no business sitting in
// notification_outbox.payload_json, which nothing purges yet.

// OutboxRow.template_key is a plain string, but these sets are authored as NotificationTemplate
// so a typo is a compile error. Widening the SET (never the key) keeps that guarantee at the
// lookup — casting the key instead would silently accept any string.

// Only the templates whose subject IS the member's own car. Excluded on purpose:
//   broadcast_release     — it announces someone else's freed spot, not their car
//   reservation_cancelled — they just pressed cancel; the plate adds nothing
//   reservation_released  — Phase 4 Slice D (e83451e) fixed this payload as aggregate-safe:
//                           released_at and no per-member field. The release sweep is the one
//                           path that fans out to many members at once, so keeping per-member
//                           data out of its payload is defence in depth against a batch ever
//                           pairing the wrong row with the wrong member. The copy loses nothing:
//                           a member holds one reservation a week, and「您 7月19日 主日保留的
//                           車位已於 10:45 釋出」already identifies it.
