// released, every still-waiting user is broadcast the freed capacity AND each member
// whose own seat was released gets one informational notice. Idempotent: a re-run
// releases 0 rows (status guard) and enqueues nothing.
//
// `notifyReleasedOwners` (default true) can be turned off by the settlement pre-sweep:
// a row released at settlement time is immediately settled to no_show, and that pastoral
// path deliberately stays silent — so the owner notice is suppressed there.
