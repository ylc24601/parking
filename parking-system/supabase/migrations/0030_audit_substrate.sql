-- Wave 2A-1 (#15): the audit substrate — an append-only governance log, written
-- inside the business transaction, that #10 (P2 review) and #14A (capacity) will
-- reuse. This migration reshapes audit_logs, adds the private writer, locks the
-- table down against the application principal, and converts ONE exemplar RPC
-- (set_admin_disabled) to prove the whole chain end to end.
--
-- ── Why audit_logs is being rebuilt rather than extended ─────────────────────────
-- The table has existed since 0003 with ZERO insert path — nothing in the codebase
-- has ever written a row (its only other reference is `enable row level security`
-- in 0004). It is empty scaffolding, so a reshape costs nothing. The guard below
-- turns that claim into an assertion rather than an assumption.
--
-- Its actor model could not have worked anyway: `actor_id uuid references users(id)`
-- can only express a MEMBER actor, but the actions worth auditing are overwhelmingly
-- taken by admins — and admins live in admin_accounts, not users. This repo has hit
-- that exact wall twice already and worked around it both times with a parallel
-- column, leaving the users(id) one dead forever (0025 decided_by_admin_id, and
-- 0028's comment: "admins live in admin_accounts, NOT users, so the legacy
-- resolved_by -> users(id) column stays unused/null forever"). audit_logs is the
-- third instance, and the only one that cannot be patched that way: its actor is
-- genuinely polymorphic (admin / staff session / member / job / system), so no
-- single FK can describe it. actor_id is therefore a SNAPSHOT REFERENCE with no FK,
-- and the log deliberately outlives the rows it points at.

-- control, not decoration. 0004 granted it blanket INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (which also
-- carries TRUNCATE) on every table; audit_logs opts back out.
--
-- Layer 1 (grants) carries TRUNCATE, which does NOT fire row-level triggers.
-- Layer 2 (triggers) carries the case where a future migration repeats 0004's
--   blanket `grant ... on all tables to service_role` and silently restores DML —
--   this repo has already done that once, so it is a demonstrated hazard, not a
--   hypothetical one.
--
-- What this does NOT claim: immutability. The owner/migration role keeps DDL — that
-- is PostgreSQL reality. This is append-only against the APPLICATION principal.
-- It also does nothing about omission: the app still chooses whether to call an
-- audited RPC at all. It raises the cost of FORGING a row, not of skipping one.

--
-- (1) SECURITY DEFINER. This is the first in the repo, and it is what lets the
--     function reach private.append_audit_log while the app cannot. Its two hazards
--     are already closed and are pinned by verify_schema so they stay closed:
--     `set search_path` is set (below), and EXECUTE is revoked from public/anon —
--     without that revoke, SECURITY DEFINER would turn this into a privilege
--     escalation vector reachable by anon through PostgREST.
--
-- (2) The signature gains p_acting_session_id and p_request_id, so the old overload
--     must be DROPPED, not replaced — `create or replace` with new parameters would
--     leave both versions callable and make the PostgREST call ambiguous.
--
-- Guard refusals stay TYPED RETURNS and are audited as result='denied'. This is
-- load-bearing, not stylistic: a `raise` would roll back the very audit row that
-- records the refusal. Only genuine infrastructure failure (the audit writer
-- erroring, the DB going away) may raise — and then rolling the business change
-- back is exactly right. #10 and #14A must be written the same way: version
-- conflict => 'conflict', capacity-below-approved => 'denied', both returned.
--
-- not_found is NOT audited: nothing was governed, it is a bad request.
