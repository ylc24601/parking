-- Wave 3 3d (#5B-a): audited, DB-authoritative gate for the member-roster CSV export.
--
-- 5A shipped roster browsing but deliberately no export (bulk PII egress is the highest
-- one-shot leak risk), leaving "who may export" to the role tier. #19 delivered the tier;
-- this migration adds the one primitive the export needs that the app cannot do itself:
-- write an audit row (private.append_audit_log is EXECUTE-locked to owner-controlled
-- SECURITY DEFINER RPCs — 0030). The same RPC also RE-AUTHORISES against the DB's current
-- role immediately before the CSV is delivered, so a role that was superadmin at the HTTP
-- gate but demoted mid-request cannot complete the egress. The route's can() is the primary
-- gate + UX; this is the DB-authoritative gate.
--
-- ── DEPLOY: additive, but still DB-FIRST ─────────────────────────────────────────
-- Adds one new RPC; removes/changes nothing. old-app + new-DB is fine. new-app + old-DB
-- makes the export route fail (RPC missing). Order stays: migration → db:verify:remote →
-- app → superadmin smoke (prod-deploy-runbook.md §1.5).
--
-- ── Divergences from the 0036 account-management template (deliberate) ────────────
-- 1. NO advisory lock: 0036's pg_advisory_xact_lock('active_superadmin_invariant') serialises
--    WRITES to admin_accounts and defends the last-superadmin invariant. This RPC only READS
--    the acting account and appends an audit row — it mutates no admin_accounts state — so it
--    needs neither the invariant nor the lock.
-- 2. Denied paths are NOT audited (v1 product decision): a refused export delivers no PII, so
--    there is nothing to record. (Contrast 0036, where a denied account-management attempt IS
--    a security-relevant event.) Only a successful, authorised export writes a row.
-- 3. Kept from 0036: acting-account read of role AND disabled_at FOR SHARE (holds the actor row
--    so a concurrent demote/disable cannot overturn this authorisation inside the audit txn);
--    role read here, never asserted by the caller; the verified role is what the audit records.
