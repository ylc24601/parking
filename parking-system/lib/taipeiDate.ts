// A timestamp for an admin table: Taipei date + 24h time. Extracted from
// BindingReview when the audit timeline (Wave 2A-2) needed the identical format —
// the repo's other Intl formatters stay put because their options genuinely differ
// (date-only sheets, time-only check-in).
//
// This is DISPLAY only. It intentionally takes a string and returns a string: any
// value round-tripped through Date loses sub-millisecond precision, which matters
// for audit's created_at (it doubles as a keyset cursor). Never feed a Date back
// into a query.
//
// Deterministic, ICU-free: Taipei is UTC+8 year-round (no DST), so shift the instant by
// the fixed offset and read UTC fields. Intl.DateTimeFormat is deliberately NOT used —
// its zh-TW output puts a THIN SPACE (U+2009) between date and time, and that codepoint
// differs between Node's bundled ICU and the browser's, so any 'use client' component that
// renders it (this page's status header, BindingReview, …) hydration-mismatches on an
// otherwise identical-looking string. Output shape matches the old zh-TW render but with a
// normal space: YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM.
