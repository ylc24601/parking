// ── This week's DEMAND side of the admin overview (Wave 3 / #32) ──────────────
// Pure, IO-free. Turns raw reservation rows into the counts the dashboard shows
// next to capacity. Lives here rather than inside the repository so the aggregation
// itself is testable against RAW rows — the property that matters most (that a P2
// count reads a frozen column and nothing else) is invisible once a repo method has
// already reduced the rows to numbers.
//
// ── effective_priority is FROZEN AT APPLY TIME, and must stay that way ────────
// The Friday allocator sorts on this very column (lib/allocation/sort.ts), so the
// overview's 「優先 N 位」 is exactly the set the allocator will treat as P2. A member
// whose eligibility is revoked AFTER applying still counts as P2 here — matching the
// allocation outcome. Deriving priority from users/eligibility instead would produce a
// second truth ("overview says 4, allocator says 3"), so this module deliberately takes
// nothing but the reservation row.

// The statuses that make up "this week's live demand + promised seats". Exported so the
// repository's .in('status', …) filter and the counter below cannot drift apart.
// Terminal states (attended / no_show / cancelled_* / walk_in) are after-the-fact
// analysis (#16), not "is there anything to handle right now".
