// Client-safe admin member DTOs. No I/O, no imports — just the shape the server has already
// made safe to show.
//
// It lives in lib/, not in the service, because the UI that renders it (MemberTable, and through
// it MemberSearch) is client-reachable, and server/services/memberAdminService pulls in
// createParkingRepository → lib/supabase/server, which builds a SERVICE-ROLE client. That module
// is protected by a comment, not by the `server-only` package, so a value import from a client
// component would bundle it silently. Keeping the type here means the UI never has a reason to
// import from the server module at all. (Same reasoning as lib/memberImportSchema.ts.)

// What an admin may see in a LIST: the phone is already masked and line_id is already reduced to
// a boolean. The full number lives only on the session-gated detail page.
