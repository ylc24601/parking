// auth module because AdminSidebar is a client component and needs the same matrix to
// hide what the operator cannot open — and server/http/adminAuth pulls in
// createParkingRepository → lib/supabase/server, which builds a SERVICE-ROLE client.
// (Same reasoning as lib/memberAdminTypes.ts.)

// ⚠️ Hiding a nav item is UX. The gate is the server-side check on every page and API
// route; this module is only what both sides agree on.
