// ── P2 eligibility date logic (Phase 8 Slice 4; reshaped by Wave 2B-2a / #10) ────
// Pure, IO-free. All dates are 'YYYY-MM-DD' calendar strings in Taipei
// (lexicographic order == chronological order).
//
// ── The as-of date is ALWAYS a parameter. Never a default, never a clock. ────────
// Two callers ask two DIFFERENT questions and each has its own correct as-of date.
// This is not an inconsistency to unify away — it is the point:
//
//   lib/allocation/priority.ts   "is this member P2 for the event on Sunday D?"
//                                -> as-of = the event's sunday_date. A decision, frozen
//                                   onto the reservation row at apply time.
//   this file's deriveEligibilityStatus / the review queue / the detail badge
//                                "does this eligibility need a human TODAY?"
//                                -> as-of = taipeiToday(now). A work queue.
//
// A member applying on Wednesday for Sunday must be judged against SUNDAY: eligibility
// that lapses on Friday must not win them a Sunday spot, and eligibility that starts on
// Saturday must not lose them one. Judge either by "today" and they are silently wrong —
// no error, just a member quietly in the wrong priority band.
//
// So the window predicate takes `asOf` and this file exports no clock. Read the call
// site and you can see which question is being asked.

}

// THE eligibility window predicate. Both ends inclusive: validFrom <= asOf <= validUntil.
// The upper bound preserves the pre-2B-2a behaviour exactly (`p2_valid_until < sundayDate`
// meant inactive, so a member IS eligible on their last day).

// ── Taiwan school-year cohort: when does a child companion's P2 end? ─────────────
// 國民教育法: 當年 9/1 前滿 6 歲者入學 — so the 9/1 cutoff is INCLUSIVE (a child born
// 9/1 is in the earlier cohort) and 9/2 begins the next one. Eligibility runs until the
// day before the school year the child enters: August 31.
//
//   born 2019-09-01 -> enters Sept 2025 -> last eligible 2025-08-31
//   born 2019-09-02 -> enters Sept 2026 -> last eligible 2026-08-31
//
// Two children born a day apart differ by a full year. That is inherent to cohort rules,
// not a bug — it is the same line the school system draws.
//
// This is the AUTHORITY for the rule; the only other copy is 0032's one-time recompute
// of pre-existing rows, which is frozen in a migration and pinned by a parity test.
// It lives in TS because the dry-run import preview must show the derived date before
// anything is written, and SQL cannot serve a preview.

//
// Precedence matters:
//   valid_until < today       → 'expired'           (silently falls back to P3 at apply time)
//   valid_from  > today       → 'not_yet_effective' (approved, but the window hasn't opened)
//   review_date <= today      → 'review_due'
//   no end and no review date → 'permanent'         (a past valid_from doesn't change that)
//   otherwise (future due)    → 'active'
// 'expired' outranks 'not_yet_effective' only defensively — the DB forbids
// valid_from > valid_until (eligibility_window_ordered_ck), so both cannot be true.
